#' Run reserve selection packages and algorithms.
#'
#' reserveselection makes it easier to call reserve selection algorithms and
#' programs like Marxan from R code.  It does this by providing functions to
#' build the required input files and option settings for each reserve
#' selector and call the reserve selector.
#'
#' The main function you're likely to need from \pkg{reserveselector} is
#' \code{\link{make_rectangular_planning_units}}.
#' Otherwise refer to the vignettes to see more details.
