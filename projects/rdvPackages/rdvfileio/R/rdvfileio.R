#' Functions to read and write matrices to 3 simple image file types.
#'
#' rdvfileio provides function calls to read and write matrices with 3 file
#' types: pgm files (.pgm), plain ascii text files (.txt), and esri format
#' ascii files (.asc).
#'
#' The main functions you're likely to need from \pkg{rdvfileio} are
#' \code{\link{write.pgm.file}}, \code{\link{write.txt.file}}, and
#' \code{\link{write.asc.file}}, though there are several variants that write
#' combinations of two or three of the file types.  See the vignette for more
#' details.
