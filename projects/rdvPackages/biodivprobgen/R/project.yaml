        #  This variable captures the tzar output path to hand it to the 
        #  tzar emulation code.  It is absolutely necessary for the current 
        #  version of emulation, but might go away in the future if River 
        #  adds emulation directly inside of tzar with a "dry run" command.
        #  Note that I had forgotten to add this variable to any of the 
        #  project.yaml files used in biodivprobgen runs before today, so 
        #  you need to add it back into any of those that you re-use under  
        #  emulation.  That's not so likely though, since they're generally 
        #  doing zillions of runs and you don't generally do that under 
        #  emulation.

            #  Runset description to print in output since the runset name has 
            #  to be short and tends to be cryptic.  The "|" should force the 
            #  saved description string to include newlines in the string.  
            #  If you don't want the newlines (i.e., you want one long string), 
            #  then use a ">" in place of the "|".
    runset_description: |
        This runset is a simple biodivprobgen test for generating 1 run  
        where the pr, r, n, and a values are all chosen from uniform random 
        distributions with a random seed of 701.  The random values chosen 
        are limited to try to be in the neighborhood of the phase transition 
        to see if there are large errors there.  
        
#  In "simple model ..." paper, they use:
#       n in [8..100] while alpha = 0.52, r = 1
#       r in [0.8..2.5] while n = 20, alpha = 0.77
#       alpha in [0.2..1] while n = 20, r = 2.5
#  In all 3 cases, best fit to the theory was when the parameter
#  was at the top of its range.  See figure 1 in the paper.
#
#  Values in the paper for propOfLinksBetweenGroups were more variable.
#  See figures 2 and 3 and text in column 2 of page 4.
#  In those examples, they had:
#       Figure 2:   k=2, alpha=0.8, r=3, n in {20,30,40}
#                   p in [0.14..0.36] w/ critical value Pcr ~ 0.23



    #  SET THIS VALUE EVERY TIME...
        #  Looks like there is currently no tzar wildcard to capture the 
        #  the runset name, but it's very useful to add it to lines of 
        #  output that will be combined with output from other runsets.

        #  NOTE that the choice of random seed in the yaml file is important 
        #  for this single run test because the example creates a test problem 
        #  based on drawing the control parameters from a random distribution.  
        #  When the seed was 111, the test crashed with the message below.  
        #  When I changed it to 701, it ran to completion.
        #       Failing:  max_possible_tot_num_links ( 3291 ) > maximum allowed ( 2000 ).

        #  parameters came up, so the yaml file could be changed to use 111 
        #  instead of 701 if you want to induce a crash to test that error 
        #  trapping.
