#' Generate problems for testing biodiversity algorithms.
#'
#' The \pkg{biodivprobgen} package is intended to make it possible to generate 
#' problems of varying difficulty, generally with known solutions and 
#' sometimes, with known degrees of difficulty. 
#' 
#' "Problems" are characterized by things like the spatial distribution of 
#' species on the landscape, the rarity distribution of species, the 
#' heterogeneity of input features such as land use and climate, etc.
