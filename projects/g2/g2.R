#  Sometimes, particularly when you're debugging, you'd like to 
#  get parameters and create an output directory in the same way that

#  to be able to use debugging tools such as the browse() command and 
#  you can't do that under tzar.

#  In that case, set emulateRunningUnderTzar=TRUE in the 
#  emulateRunningUnderTzar.R file.  
#  If you really do want to run under tzar rather than emulating it, 
#  then set emulateRunningUnderTzar=FALSE there.

#  If you don't want to do either of the above, then you have to somehow 
#  build your parameters list data structure yourself.

#  In that case, if emulation is turned off, there is no problem.
#  If you've left emulation turned on, then there are likely to be errors 
#  in here when the emulation code tries to figure out where to read the 
#  parameters file, etc.

#  History:

#  2014 01 31 - BTL
#  Created as the beginning of stripping the guppy project down and getting
#  rid of all the python code in it.
#  Largely basing it on runMaxent.R from:
#  GuppyRev256_from2013.05.20_justBeforePython_exportedFromCornerstone_2014.01.20/guppy.
#  Will also mix in things from the latest version of guppy as well, but
#  runMaxent.R from guppy revision 256 (on google code repository) is pretty
#  much the last version of the code after submitting the sewpac first year
#  report and before I started adding python to the project (other than the
#  overarching dummy model.py code that was required for using tzar at the
#  time, but all that did was immediately call runMaxent.R).

#===============================================================================

#  To run this code locally using tzar (by calling the R code from model.py):

#      cd /Users/bill/D/rdv-framework

#      java -jar tzar.jar execlocalruns ./projects/g2/
    
#    The only yaml file variables that seem to be referenced in the code here.
# PAR.current.run.directory = outputFiles$'PAR.current.run.directory'
# PAR.path.to.maxent = variables$'PAR.path.to.maxent'
# PAR.input.directory = inputFiles$'PAR.input.directory'
# PAR.maxent.env.layers.base.name = variables$'PAR.maxent.env.layers.base.name'
# PAR.path.to.maxent.input.data = variables$'PAR.path.to.maxent.input.data'

#===============================================================================

                        #  Conventions

#  get...() functions
#       A common pattern in here is that some piece of data could
#       come from multiple possible sources, e.g., copying from the
#       current hard disk or from a url or being generated from a
#       sampling or simulation process.  At the highest level,
#       I will call those functions get...() rather than load...()
#       or generate...(), etc.  Wherever get...() occurs, my
#       intent is to have it eventually be a generic routine.

#  SrcDir vs. WorkingDir
#       Trying to make names differentiate between the source of information
#       before the experiment is run and the working copy of information that
#       is copied into the tzar output area as part of the experiment.
#       For example, the environmental input layers generally exist in some
#       independent data storage location (possibly not even on the same disk)
#       and are often selected and then copied into a working area that is part
#       the experiment's output area under tzar.  So, envLayersSrcDir
#       may get copied into envLayersWorkingDir.


#===============================================================================

#  Can't do this under tzar because it erases the parameters list passed in 
#  from yaml!!

#  Does R already manage this in strings for file functions?

#  all the slashes in a file name have to be going in the right

#  Here's what the options() help page in R says:
#
#    warn:
#    sets the handling of warning messages. If warn is negative all warnings
#    are ignored. If warn is zero (the default) warnings are stored until
#    the topâ€“level function returns. If fewer than 10 warnings were signalled
#    they will be printed otherwise a message saying how many were signalled.
#    An object called last.warning is created and can be printed through the
#    function warnings. If warn is one, warnings are printed as they occur.
#    If warn is two or larger all warnings are turned into errors.

#options (warn = 2)    #  This will eventually come from yaml file

#  Windows and mac and linux have different path conventions.
#  While R can deal with most of these, it can't handle things like
#  VMware Windows on the mac having a special way of specifying where a

#  So, I have to make a special variable for the lead-in on lots of path
#  names to have this work across OS variations.

#  Need to replace these kinds of boolean switches with a single

#  *******************************  DESIGN NOTE  *******************************
#  QUESTION FOR RIVER:
#  Is there a way to have options in the yaml file that don't require massive
#  switch statements in the code yet are not vulnerable to injection attacks?
#
#  Nearly everything that I want to do involves subclassing generic functions
#  to allow reusability of many variations of a small number of basic actions.
#  If I'm coding things up directly (i.e., without using yaml inputs to
#  select options), then it's easy to reuse these objects/generics.
#  However, as soon as I add yaml to the mix, I'm not sure it's possible.
#  Then again, there are other issues with that too, because each variant of
#  the generic function will probably have a different set of arguments that
#  would be hard to encode in yaml too.
#  Maybe I have to be restricting myself to having a set of basic sub-g2
#  programs and having specific yaml files that correspond to each of those
#  sub-g2 files and know exactly which options need to be set.
#  This might require or work well with some kind of a convention where every
#  sub-g2 was expected to have a corresponding yaml template with default
#  values for each option.
#  The user would then just fill in any values on that template where they
#  didn't want the defaults.
#  Could this yaml file also be used as the input for a generic program that
#  dynamically built a gui for each sub-g2 and then wrote the user's entries
#  on the gui back to a yaml file for that run?

    #  reserve selection.  
    #  The current value for this is set in initializeG2options.R based on a 
    #  value handed in from the yaml file.  However, that's based on old 
    #  code that specified the number of species to be created in the yaml file.
    #  Currently, the number of species is derived from counting the number 
    #  of clusters in the cluster image, so it can be different from any other 
    #  image and it can be different from what the yaml file thinks.  
    #  So, just to get a few quick runs going tonight, I'm going to set 
    #  the value right here to the number of species that the cluster counts 
    #  showed.
