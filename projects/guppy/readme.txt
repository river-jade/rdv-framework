This project has not yet been modified to run with tzar 0.4.0 and above.

Modifying it should be as straightforward as uncommenting the runner_class attribute in projectparams.yaml,
however Guppy is not running for me (it's complaining about a missing panda module; I assume it's a third party
library).
